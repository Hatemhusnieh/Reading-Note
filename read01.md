# Mastering Markdown on GitHub

**Markdown** is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document, like making the text *italic* or **bold** etc.

One can use Markdown most places around GitHub like:

* Gists
* Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
* Files with the .md or .markdown extension  

Here are some markdown syntaxes:

* Headers: for header we use h1 to h6 (descending order for size)
* Emphasis: for *italic* we put text between **either (*) or (-)** like this [* text *]
            for **bold** we put text between **either double (*) or (-)** like this [**text** ]
            they can also be combined  

* Lists: for list we have to options.
a) Unordered list: we use (*)
b) Ordered list: we use (number like 1,2,3,etc) or (letters like a,b,c,etc)  

* Images: we use this format to link images: 
**![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png) Format: ![Alt Text](url)**  

* Links: wed use this format:
**http://github.com - automatic!**
**[GitHub](http://github.com)**  

* Blockquotes: we use (>)  

* Inline code: we put elements inside to angel brackets that are inside ti single quotation marks like this ['<element>']  

GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax that provides an additional set of useful features, many of which make it easier to work with content on GitHub.com. 

We can also apply the following:

* Syntax highlighting
* Task Lists
* Tables
* SHA references
* Issue references within a repository
* Username @mentions
* Automatic linking for URLs
* Strikethrough
* and finally Emojis.
