* **`<meta>`** this element only exist inside the **head** element and give information about your site
* there are **Escape characters** that are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.  

## HTML5 Layout
* The new HTML5 elements i XX ndicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
* The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple `<div>`elements).
* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
* o make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.  

## Process & Design  
* Designing the web site is fatal in increasing the number of visitors to your site
* You must know Who is the Site For 'either individual or companies' prior to design, and the need of its visitors and how to get the message right
* styling the site is very important for showing what is what, what is important and how to serve with minimal effort
* Navigation through the site must be easy and functional.
