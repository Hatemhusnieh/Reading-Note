## Growth Mindset
when we say **Growth Mindset** we mean this:  
*growth mindset believes that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.*  

in other words ! To have a growing mindset is to work hard, be adaptive, be efficient, and be dynamic add open to change.
**TALENT** and **INTELLIGENCE** are are considered fixed and not adaptive or dynamic.  
***here is a sketch to illustrait what I mean***

I always aim at having a growth in mind and so I have **three rules**:  
1. never criticize and ignore it.
2. If no **PAIN** there is mo **GAIN**
3. Always embrace challenges

### My Favorite EVER:
[Never too Late](https://youtu.be/lL2ZwXj1tXM)  
Lyrics:  
>This world will never be
What I expected  
And if I don't belong  
Who would have guessed it  
I will not leave alone  
Everything that I own  
To make you feel like it's not too late  
It's never too late  
Even if I say  
It'll be alright  
Still I hear you say  
You want to end your life  
Now and again, we try  
To just stay alive  
Maybe we'll turn it all around   
'Cause it's not too late  
It's never too late  
No one will ever see  
This side reflected  
And if there's something wrong  
Who would have guessed it  
And I have left alone  
Everything that I own  
To make you feel like  
It's not too late
It's never too late  
Even if I say  
It'll be alright  
Still I hear you say  
You want to end your life  
Now and again, we try  
To just stay alive  
Maybe we'll turn it all around  
'Cause it's not too late  
It's never too…
