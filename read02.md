## Choosing a Text Editor

In the process of learning web development, one need to write a big load of code lines.. possessing a good text editor will make this journey easier. A text editor is  a software that programmers use to write codes. While writing codes is possible without using editors, editors are very helpful and can make a world change while coding.

There are dozens of text editors to choose from, and many have different features. But to make the process of choosing easier, one can look for the following most important features a text editor might have. These features include:

1. Code Completion: where the editor will suggest for the user several options related to what the user has typed. This will save allot of time and prevents some mistakes.

2. Emmet: Emmet allows the user to write **HTML** and **CSS** more efficiently and quickly.

3. Text-Highlighting: With this feature the editor will colorize the text according to its function, so numbers with certain color and certain command word with same color etc.

4. Themes: The option of changing the themes of the editor and text itself is very useful, specially to relief the eyes.

5. Extensions: which gives the user more capabilities and functionalities.

At the base form all operating systems have a text editor on them(**Notepad** for *Windows* and **Text Edit** for *MacOS*), but these editors are mostly basic and contains almost no features. There are many third party text editors to pick from. Like, **NotePad++** for only Windows, **BB** Edit for only Mac and **Visual Studio Code**, **Atom**, **Brackets**, **Sublime Text** which are for Windows, MacOS and Linux, and are considered **IDEs** (Integrated Development Environment).

### The Command Line (Links to an external site.)

The ***command line*** is a very interesting tool, it add so much to the **UI** and **GUI**. A command line, or **terminal**, is a text based interface to the system. Here commands are entered directly. this is a faster way to perform functions without missing with UI and GUI. We call the response for a command a Prompt.  

Opening the **Terminal** is very easy, and it can be performed by several methods like,  in **MacOS** one can use Terminal , and for **Linux** one must find Applications or it maybe on the desktop through a right-click! and then "Open in terminal".  And if **Windows**  and intend to remotely log into another machine then one will need an **SSH** client. A rather good one is Putty (Links to an external site.) (free) .

 Within the Terminal there is something called the **Shell**. This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you. Also, the Terminal is full of shortcuts that will turn the programming environment to an easy ride.

### Basic Navigation

*There are many prompts to navigate the system like the following:*

* **PDW** : Stands for Print Working Directory. it tells where is the current directory
* **LS** : Stands for List. It show a list of what the current directory has. But Ls has more features too
* **~ (tilde)** : This is a shortcut for home directory
* **. (dot)** : This is a reference to your current directory
* **.. (dotdot)** : This is a reference to the parent directory
* **cd** : Stands for change directory. it moves the pointer to another directory.   

### About Files

1. First. Everything in Linux is a file! Second. Linux knows no Extensions. In other words, while Windows can determine the type of a file by its extension, Linux does not care! regardless of the extension Linux will try to figure what the type of a file is alnoe.

2. Second. Something important about Linux that it is **Case Sensitive**. That means a mistake is not ignored and prompting command with one letter wrong might either not work  or perform a different action.

For **Spaces**, they are valid, but they could use some problem. So whenever we want to use a sentence with a space between words. we could either use the name or sentence inside Quotes. Or use escape character, which is a backslash ( \ ).

In Linux a dot (.) in the beginning of a file name will hide it. So to hide a file of a directory, just create/rename with a dot (.) at the beginning.
